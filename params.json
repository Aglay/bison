{"name":"Bison","tagline":"Mirror Of git://git.savannah.gnu.org/bison.git","body":"This package contains the GNU Bison parser generator.\r\n\r\n* Installation\r\n** Build\r\nSee the file INSTALL for generic compilation and installation\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\nBison requires GNU m4 1.4.6 or later.  See:\r\n\r\n      ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/m4/m4-1.4.6.tar.gz\r\n\r\n** Internationalization\r\nBison supports two catalogues: one for Bison itself (i.e., for the\r\nmaintainer-side parser generation), and one for the generated parsers\r\n(i.e., for the user-side parser execution).  The requirements between\r\nboth differ: bison needs ngettext, the generated parsers do not.  To\r\nsimplify the build system, neither are installed if ngettext is not\r\nsupported, even if generated parsers could have been localized.  See\r\nhttp://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bison/2009-08/msg00006.html for\r\nmore details.\r\n\r\n* Questions\r\nSee the section FAQ in the documentation (doc/bison.info) for\r\nfrequently asked questions.  The documentation is also available in\r\nPDF and HTML, provided you have a recent version of Texinfo installed:\r\nrun \"make pdf\" or \"make html\".\r\n\r\nIf you have questions about using Bison and the documentation does\r\nnot answer them, please send mail to <help-bison@gnu.org>.\r\n\r\n* Bug reports\r\nPlease send bug reports to <bug-bison@gnu.org>.  Please include the\r\nversion number from 'bison --version', and a complete, self-contained\r\ntest case in each bug report.\r\n\r\n* Copyright statements\r\nFor any copyright year range specified as YYYY-ZZZZ in this package,\r\nnote that the range specifies every single year in that closed interval.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocal Variables:\r\nmode: outline\r\nEnd:\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 1992, 1998-1999, 2003-2005, 2008-2013 Free Software\r\nFoundation, Inc.\r\n\r\nThis file is part of Bison, the GNU Compiler Compiler.\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
